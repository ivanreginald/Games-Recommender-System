A horde of enemies is invading, and it's up to the player to stop them by strategically building fortification towers around their base.  Beautiful environments, spectacular effects, and a dynamic, engaging soundtrack bring the world to life.  The controls are intuitive and the gameplay is deep — the special attacks and properties of each tower work together to provide many ways to succeed.                    <br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>High Replayability</strong> There are approximately 8 hours of gameplay in the main storyline, and many hours of play in challenge modes that give players unique starting conditions and objectives.  Each game level is very replayable, and can be solved in many different ways, with increasing rewards for improved efficiency.                     <br>					</li><li><strong>Wide Variety of Enemies</strong> Over the course of the game, players battle 15 different enemy types that become increasingly stronger, and employ a variety of strategies in an attempt to bypass the player's defenses.  As the levels progress, the enemies become tougher and more difficult to defeat.                    <br>					</li><li><strong>20 Unique Levels</strong>  Defense Grid: The Awakening has 20 unique environments, each with a different placement of roads, tower build locations, and open areas to plan a strategy around.                     <br>					</li><li><strong>Numerous Tower Options and Upgrades</strong> There are 10 different tower types with 3 levels of capability each.  Each tower has unique trade offs that affect ideal placement, such as line-of-sight attack or ballistic trajectory fire.  Some towers improve other nearby towers, and some are ideal at specific locations, such as a rear guard tower that unleashes a devastating attack.                      <br>					</li><li><strong>Steam Achievements</strong> Successfully completing each level provides a bronze achievement award.

The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. This world was not made for you to understand. <br />
<br />
But as you explore, slowly, meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes might start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after all. The game is not here to fight you; it is inviting you to dance.<br />

Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect.

When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area.

The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit.

High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps.

Working for Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for colonisation, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the planet’s energy supply – Thermal Energy.<br />

Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/244850/extras/repair_gif.gif?t=1555574351"" ><br><br>Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.<br><br>Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/244850/extras/drop_pod_gif.gif?t=1555574351"" ><br><br>Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future.

You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases.<br><br><strong>SANDBOX GAME</strong><br>Each game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands.<br><br><strong>CRAFTING</strong><br>One feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves.<br><br><strong>RTS</strong><br>At the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision.

You can speed up the movement of the dwarves, open small portals, illuminate dark caves to scare away monsters, evoke natural magic in the form of rain or tree growth, hurl fireballs at the monsters’ heads, and find useful resources and hidden rooms underground, thereby helping to speed up resource extraction, exploration of the world, and the population growth of your assistants.","Craft The World is a unique sandbox strategy game, the  mix of Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress.<br>Explore a random generated world populated by dangerous creatures, build a dwarf fortress, gather resources, and craft all the items, weapons, and armor you need.<br><br><br><strong>GOD-SIMULATION</strong><br>You control a tribe of dwarves by giving them commands to dig in certain places, attack enemy creatures, and build houses and other structures. You'll need to provide your dwarves food and clothing, as well as help them with magic when fighting against other inhabitants of the world. You start the game with one dwarf and gain additional dwarves as your experience level increases.<br><br><strong>SANDBOX GAME</strong><br>Each game level has many layers of earth to explore, from the sky down to boiling subterranean lava. The level is randomly generated as an island, restricted by natural boundaries: oceans on the edges, lava beneath it, and the sky above. Other features include day and night and changing weather conditions. The worlds differ in size, humidity, temperature, terrain, and flora and fauna. Abandoned halls and rooms with treasure are hidden somewhere deep within the islands.<br><br><strong>CRAFTING</strong><br>One feature of the game is a user-friendly system of recipes for crafting. The recipes are organized and easily accessible. You can craft dozens of different items: building blocks for houses, furniture, decorations, weapons, armor, ammunition, and food for your dwarves.<br><br><strong>RTS</strong><br>At the outset you find the recipes for basic tools and items, and build a small house with places to sleep and eat. Then, the size of the tribe increases and catches the attention of other inhabitants of the world. Most of them are night creatures and dwell underground. The worlds are full of fantasy creatures like zombies, skeletons, goblins, beholders, ghosts, giant spiders, and others. Some of them pay little attention to the dwarves, as long as the dwarves do not come into their field of vision.

The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? <h2 class=""bb_tag"">This War of Mine:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Inspired by real-life events<br></li><li>Control your survivors and manage your shelter<br></li><li>Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive<br></li><li>Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience<br></li><li>Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game<br></li><li>Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">IGN</h2><i>This War of Mine might be the war game we need.</i><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gamespot</h2><i>I was intrigued by This War of Mine's attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves.</i><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Game Informer</h2><i>11bit is blazing a new thematic trail amidst the currently popular survival genre, and so far the studio seems to have something special on its hand.</i><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Other 11 bit studios titles:</h2><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/330020/Children_of_Morta/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  id=""dynamiclink_3"" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/330020/Children_of_Morta/</a><br><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/323190/Frostpunk/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  id=""dynamiclink_4"" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/323190/Frostpunk/</a><br><a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  id=""dynamiclink_5"" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/</a>","In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle."

Just an ordinary young man with thousands, even hundreds of thousands of those like him in every ordinary city. But one day something completely unusual happens to him: he falls asleep in a bus in winter and wakes up... in the middle of a hot summer. In front of him is &quot;Sovyonok&quot; - a pioneer camp, behind him is his former life. To understand what happened to him, Semyon will have to get to know the local inhabitants (and maybe even find love), find his way in the complex labyrinth of human relationships and his own problems and solve the camp's mysteries. And answer the main question - how to come back? Should he come back?","Meeting Semyon, the game's main character, you would've never paid attention to him.

In this one we're making a number of big changes and it's time for another make-over for Proxy.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FRAGMENT CASE UPDATE</h2><br>Long story short, Fragment Cases will no longer drop after you complete matches.<br><br>Short story long, we know that many of you find the Fragment cases a little underwhelming when you earn them and they're added to your inventory, so we thought of a better way for you to earn Fragments in a bit of a more interesting way (Read the next section to find out what)<br><br>Psst. If you have any Fragment Cases in your inventory, don't worry! Those won't be going anywhere, so you can save them for the memories or open them at your leisure.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">INCREASED LOADOUT CASE DROP RATES</h2><br>Enter the replacement for Fragment Cases! We've more than DOUBLED the drop rate of Loadout Cases at the end of matches so your Loadout Card earn rate will increase significantly. But how does this give you more Fragments? Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average over time than you were before.<br><br>With this update we've also added your Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have. This should also help new and existing players get to know the Crafting system a bit more, making it easier to interact with and giving it more visibility.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">OBSIDIAN OPERATIVE PROXY</h2><br>Skydaddy brought home the bacon in the last update with his epic Obsidian overhaul, but now it's Proxy's turn to bring home a bigger piece of bacon (and hopefully a better metaphor).<br><br>When trying to describe this Obsidian it's difficult to not use words like &quot;f*****g awesome&quot;, &quot;holy s**t&quot; and &quot;very nice&quot;.
